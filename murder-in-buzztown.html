            <p>
              This game was my third project as a lead in HomeTeamGameDev. By
              this time I've come to understand a lot of my shortcomings
              regarding development, so I focused on creating a short proof of
              concept of a genre I like a lot (metroidvanias) with a mixture of
              things I like a lot (detective series), and while the outcome is
              more of a platformer (due to the time restrictions), I think it
              lays a solid foundation if I want to keep developing the idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              This has also been the project where I've been most consistent
              with my contributions (I'd estimate I've spent 6&ndash;8 hours
              weekly) and where I've been more conscious of my choices in art
              and level design. I still wish I could improve things (like the
              enemy AI), but overall, I am quite proud of what I have
              accomplished.
