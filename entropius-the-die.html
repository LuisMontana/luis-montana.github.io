              Entropius, the die, was an entry for GMTK Jam 2022. The theme was
              Roll of the Die. For this game, none of my usual friends and
              contributors were able to help. Since I had experience doing pixel
              art from Waking Graves, I decided to do everything myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel quite happy with the result; the game obtained a #1730 spot
              in creativity out of 6,000 entries, and overall it was 3145. I did
              everything myself, and I focused more on the UX, which was
              something I missed in a lot of my previous jam entries. This
              actually subtracted from my level of design time, but I think
              people liked the concept enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              I kept everything mostly monochromatic so I wouldn't spend too
              much time thinking about color theory or how to design the
              characters, and the die was actually a godsend in that regard.
