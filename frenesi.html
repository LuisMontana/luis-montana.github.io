              <b> Released on July 12, 2020. </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Created for Game Makers Toolkit Game Jam 2020. The theme was out
              of control. This game was developed by me, Jessica Dominguez
              (designer), and Juan Franco (UX and scripting). We decided to take
              the "out of control" part and force it into other characters. As
              mentioned in the description of Mama, so fast I grew fond of pixel
              art and puzzle games, and given the restrictive nature of game
              jams and the reduced possibility of bugs in puzzle games, we
              thought it was a no-brainer.

            <p><b>My Contributions: </b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Project Lead:</b> Once again, I assembled a group of friends
                interested in creating a game for the jam and pointed everyone
                in a centralized direction so that we could finish on time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Movement programming:</b>
                I improved on Mama So Fast's movement system to better handle
                movement animations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Grid-level creation:</b>
                system using Unity's experimental tile system (it has not yet
                been incorporated into Unity's core)
              </li>
              <li>Enemy AI and enemy control system programming</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>My learnings and things to improve: </b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                usage of Unity's grid system (which I keep using in most of my
                2D projects). It allows for a really fast prototyping stage, and
                it is really powerful.
              </li>
              <li>
                The importance of audio was really relevant here. I think it
                makes a huge difference that the game has nothing, and it's so
                much worse because of it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adding more enemies will improve variance and increase
                challenges.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improving enemy AI since time restrictions only allowed me to do
                very basic AI scripting
              </li>
            </ul>
