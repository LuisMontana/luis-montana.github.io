              <b> released on April 21, 2018. </b>
              This game was created for a contest on puzzle games; the deadline
              was pretty close, so we decided to take a game-jam-style approach
              to its development.
            </p>
            <p><b>My Contributions: </b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Project Lead: I determined what was going to make the final cut
                and what wasn't, and I assigned tasks to my two co-developers: a
                designer and another developer
              </li>
              <li>
                Core gameplay design: I implemented the grid-based movement
                system. I also created a script to read text files with matrix
                representations of levels so that the designer could rapidly
                mock levels and they could be tested in-game. I implemented the
                sound and scene management scripts
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              first "finished" project. I learned a lot from implementing the
              grid creation system, and after its development, I tended to
              develop games using pixel art and grid-based puzzle games, since I
              found the experience extremely satisfactory. It was also an
              enriching experience managing a team over a short span of time
              with big effort pushes.
