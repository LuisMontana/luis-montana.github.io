              <b> Released on February 1, 2021. </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Developed for Global Game Jam 2021. The theme was "Lost and
              Found". The Name is a Joke on the naming conventions of the Sega
              Genesis' Sonic games. For the lost and found we started with the
              idea of having two characters: Lost and Found which were trying to
              reconnect, it eventually devolved into a lovecraftian story (as
              most things do) and we had an old captain trying to escape an
              ancient prison which also holds a eldritch horror prisoner which
              require's Juancho's help to escape. The core idea was that you
              would use audio cues to find traps that the horror could
              deactivate but required the captain's input to use its powers.

            <ul>
              <li>
                This was the first project where i used wwise and it was pretty
                challenging as using it with version control was quite painful
                but the functionalities to have an "adaptive" audio were what we
                needed most so we had to use it. sadly wwise didnt work at the
                time with Unity's webgl so we had to conform with a regular
                build download.
              </li>
              <li>
                Better ux, I feel like the game becomes a rinse a repeat game.
                it also forces you to brute force a bit and I wish we could
                improve on the great audio system so it becomes more obvious to
                the player that traps are nearby.
