              Waking Graves is an action platformer inspired by Megaman X and
              the NES Castlevanias. This was developed between October 2021 and
              January 2022, with weekly contributions of 2-4 hours.

                <b>Art Direction:</b>
                This was the first game where I did most of the pixel art,
                including animations.

            <p><b>My learnings and things to improve: </b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This project was my first as a lead in HomeTeamGameDev and also
                my first doing pixel art (which I still love to this day). This
                was also the first project where I wholly planned the project
                before development (we use a kanban-weekly approach in HTGD),
                and from a production point of view, it gave me a lot of
                insights on my planning shortcomings, such as focusing too much
                on the bottlenecks I had in gamejams (art) and not focusing
                enough on gameplay.
              </li>
              <li>
                I also learned a lot from my mentor (Chris deLeon) for project
                management and learned to cut content to complete the project on
                schedule.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gameplay improvements such as better platforming and major
                tweaks to movement
              </li>
              <li>More challenging Enemies</li>
            </ul>
