              The thrill of the wheel is a car-based arena game inspired by
              Vigilante 8 and Twisted metal. It was developed between october
              23rd of 2022 and released on march 25th of 2023. this was my first
              full 3D project, as such I determined i would give it more time
              than my other projects.

                <b>Art Direction:</b>
                I modelled the island and created around 50% of the 3d assets.
                Also created all the ui.

            <p><b>My learnings and things to improve: </b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This project was my first doing 3D, figuring out the movement
                scripts for a car was quite complex and it took a significant
                part of the time i hoped to use developing other things. I had
                expected the 3D to be significantly harder than doing 2D but
                that was not the case and it was a relief.
              </li>
              <li>
                I hoped to create a more distinctive identity for each of the
                cars but time forced me to cut a lot of features from it
