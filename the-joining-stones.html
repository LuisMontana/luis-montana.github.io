              <b> Released on June 13, 2021. </b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Developed for GMTK Game Jam 2021. The theme was "Joined Together".
              We rapidly decided on what we wanted to do and how to acomplish
              it. It is a basic platformer where you can join stones to overcome
              certain hurdles.

            <ul>
              <li>
                This project was extremely well organized and it was the first
                gamejam where the final release didn't have major bugs, it was
                also the first one where we didn't end up feeling rushed and
                burned out.
              </li>
              <li>
                It also presented the issue of joining multiple objects with
                different colliders which can cause unexpected interactions, but
                i was pretty happy with the outcome given the time constraints.
              </li>
              <li>
                Better UX and more challenging level design, to improve the
                user's challenge and understanding of the game and give them
                more options to solve the puzzles.
