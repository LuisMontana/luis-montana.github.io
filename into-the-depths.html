            <p>
              This game was a personal project I developed using Unity. I had
              the idea of creating a game with as few assets as possible, so I
              hired my designer friend to create a specific amount of assets to
              see what I could build with them. I already had work done on the
              concept for Ludum Dare 43 with a friend and liked the idea enough
              to extend the development.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core idea was that to advance to higher levels, you had to
              sacrifice either your life, your sanity, or your items. With lower
              sanity levels, enemies and hazards become more dangerous, but with
              low life, a single mistake could cost you your life. Items were
              also good to keep around so you could use them in specific
              situations. The whole idea of "making your own difficulty" has
              always attracted me, and I've tried to incorporate it into some of
              my games, but I feel I'm still pulling something that leaves me
              satisfied
            </p>
            <p><b>My Contributions: </b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Project Lead:</b> I decided everything besides the art
                direction and music design. I gave the designer a list of which
                assets I needed and what type of monsters I wanted, and I gave
                her creative freedom for the assets as long as they followed the
                requirements I established.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Core gameplay design:</b>
                After the initial game jam entry, which only used life, I
                determined that to have more depth, more systems were required.
                I decided that sanity and items would provide a nice balancing
                act for players to play the game with a certain level of
                freedom.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Movement System implementation:</b>
                I had never developed a game with an "isometric" perspective, so
                I had to get a bit creative with my code to make everything work
                (even if it didn't work as I intended in some cases).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>My learnings and things to improve: </b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The combat system didn't end up as I wanted, and it was easy for
                the monster that followed you to kind of lock you out of killing
                them because the diagonal movement made it too difficult to keep
                them far enough.
              </li>
              <li>
                I would definitely give more time to the level design; they feel
                too empty and have a feeling of "sameness."
              </li>
